# DETR Results

## Dataset
The MS-COCO dataset was used to evaluate the DETR model. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Performance Metrics
- **Frames Per Second (FPS)**: 10 FPS
- **Average Precision (AP)@0.5**: 57.2%
- **Average Precision (AP)@0.75**: 37.8%

## Visualizations

## Conclusion
The DETR model simplifies the object detection process with its Transformer-based approach but has higher computational demands. It performs well on the MS-COCO dataset but is less suitable for real-time applications.
