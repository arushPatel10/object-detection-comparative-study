# CenterNet Results

## Dataset
The MS-COCO dataset was used to evaluate the CenterNet model. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Performance Metrics
- **Frames Per Second (FPS)**: 15 FPS
- **Average Precision (AP)@0.5**: 55.3%
- **Average Precision (AP)@0.75**: 35.0%

## Visualizations

## Conclusion
The CenterNet model achieved accurate localization of objects on the MS-COCO dataset. However, its slower inference time makes it less suitable for real-time applications compared to other models.
