# FCOS Results

## Dataset
The MS-COCO dataset was used to evaluate the FCOS model. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Performance Metrics
- **Frames Per Second (FPS)**: 20 FPS
- **Average Precision (AP)@0.5**: 58.1%
- **Average Precision (AP)@0.75**: 38.5%

## Visualizations

## Conclusion
The FCOS model simplifies the object detection process and performs well on the MS-COCO dataset. However, it may struggle with detecting smaller objects compared to other models.
