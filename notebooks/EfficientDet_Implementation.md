# EfficientDet

## Overview
EfficientDet builds upon EfficientNet by introducing a BiFPN (Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network) for feature extraction, providing a scalable and efficient way to perform object detection.

## Methodology
- **Base Network**: EfficientNet.
- **BiFPN**: Bidirectional Weighted Feature Pyramid Network for efficient feature fusion.
- **Scalability**: Backbone network and BiFPN layers are repeated based on resource constraints.

## Observations
- **Strengths**: Efficient, scalable, good accuracy.
- **Weaknesses**: Complex implementation.

## Conclusion
EfficientDet provides a highly scalable and efficient approach to object detection, suitable for real-time applications with varying resource constraints.
