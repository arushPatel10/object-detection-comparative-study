# You Only Look Once v4 (YOLOv4)

## Overview
YOLOv4 is an improvement over the original YOLO model, focusing on speed and accuracy. It uses multi-scale features and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously.

## Methodology
- **Base Network**: DarkNet-53.
- **Multi-Scale Features**: Utilizes Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) for extracting features at multiple scales.
- **Bounding Box Predictions**: Uses anchor boxes and predefined shapes to improve localization accuracy.

## Observations
- **Strengths**: High speed and accuracy, suitable for real-time applications.
- **Weaknesses**: Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.

## Conclusion
YOLOv4 is highly effective for real-time object detection, balancing speed and accuracy efficiently.
