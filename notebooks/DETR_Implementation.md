# Detection Transformer (DETR)

## Overview
DETR (Detection Transformer) represents a significant shift in object detection methodologies by employing a Transformer-based architecture for end-to-end object detection.

## Methodology
- **Base Network**: Transformer-based architecture.
- **End-to-End Detection**: Treats object detection as a set prediction problem, using global loss and bipartite matching.
- **Bounding Box Predictions**: Directly predicts object bounding boxes and classes.

## Observations
- **Strengths**: Simplified pipeline, reduces the need for intricate components.
- **Weaknesses**: Higher computational cost.

## Conclusion
DETR simplifies the object detection process with its Transformer-based approach but comes with higher computational demands.
