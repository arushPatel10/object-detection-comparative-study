# Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)

## Overview
The Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is a popular object detection model that detects objects in images and videos. It predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the full images in a single forward pass.

## Methodology
- **Base Network**: VGG16 without fully connected layers.
- **Additional Feature Layers**: Convolutional layers added to the base network to predict detections at multiple scales.
- **Bounding Box Predictions**: Generated at multiple layers with different scales.

## Observations
- **Strengths**: Fast detection, suitable for real-time applications.
- **Weaknesses**: Struggles with detecting small objects accurately.

## Conclusion
The SSD model provides a good balance between speed and accuracy, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time object detection.
