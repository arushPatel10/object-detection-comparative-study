# Comprehensive Survey and Performance Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Object Detection Algorithms

This project is a comprehensive comparative study of state-of-the-art object detection methods, including SSD, CenterNet, FCOS, YOLOv4, DETR, and EfficientDet. The study aims to provide insightful guidance for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision.

## Objectives
- Compare the performance of different object detection algorithms using the MS-COCO dataset.
- Evaluate performance metrics such as Frames Per Second (FPS) and Average Precision (AP).

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each object detection method.
- `src/`: Core Python scripts implementing each detection method.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `LICENSE`: License for the project.
